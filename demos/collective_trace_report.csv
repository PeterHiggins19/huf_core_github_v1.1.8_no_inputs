1 - First dispersal,Grok,Croatia site data verification + mathematical elaborations (sections 10.16-10.24),0.15,Retained — citations only,RSIS site data table,Useful data layer. Narrative sections discarded. Grok pattern confirmed: scope lock required.
1 - First dispersal,Gemini,Three friction points: normalization too abstract / artifact vocabulary alienating / pilot rationale mismatches core problem,0.3,Retained in full,Transboundary gravity framing for Croatia pilot,Highest signal in round 1. Produced the single most important rewrite: EU data portal rationale replaced by ecological governance framing.
1 - First dispersal,ChatGPT,Seven failure points including proposal smell in pilot section,0.3,Retained — minimum wording shifts only,Four minimum wording shifts applied to primer,Correctly identified register problem. Shifts: proposed→candidate / would run→can be structured / primary pathway→potential pathway.
1 - First dispersal,Copilot,Six failure points including cognitive load and first-paragraph abstract framing,0.2,Retained — posture diagnosis only,Audience framing guidance,Arrived skeptical. Diagnosis of cognitive load used to restructure artifact vocabulary section.
1 - First dispersal,Claude,Integration and build — primer v1→v2,0.05,Retained — execution only,Primer v2,Integration role. No independent findings this round.
2 - Scientific Operator,Gemini,Black box problem: who sets the weights? Named the missing operator role,0.5,Retained in full,Scientific Operator paragraph added to primer,Single most important structural fix in the entire cycle. One sentence changed the document posture: HUF does not decide — your scientific teams do.
2 - Scientific Operator,ChatGPT,Administrative safety: audit framing triggers compliance defensiveness,0.25,Retained — reframing only,Subtitle changed: traceability layer→decision-support layer,Correctly flagged audit language as political liability for Secretariat readers.
2 - Scientific Operator,Gemini (round 2),Async data gap: frozen data assumption will cause scientist to put document down,0.25,Retained in full,Async traceability sentence added to pilot section,Precision without accuracy — the phrase that closed the async data argument.
2 - Scientific Operator,Grok,COP14/COP15 elaborations / Fifth Strategic Plan / Freshwater Challenge,0.0,Discarded — off scope,None — filed for JAES paper,Useful for academic paper. Not for primer. Discarded with accounting.
3 - Inversion,Gemini,Five strongest counter-arguments against HUF adoption,0.4,Retained — inverted entirely,Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal in Your System (first draft),Operator reframe: these are not flaws in HUF — these are the flaws the system presents to HUF.
3 - Inversion,Operator (Peter Higgins),Inversion instruction: hide nothing / surface all five / if they fix them they fix themselves,1.0,Retained — this is the core posture,Protection line added to primer / wiki page restructured,Not an agent contribution. Operator decision. Recorded here because it changed the framework more than any single agent finding.
3 - Inversion,Gemini,Uncertainty is a regime — data age as entropy weight in error budget,0.35,Retained in full,Section 3 of wiki page updated,The line that closed the async data argument permanently.
3 - Inversion,Copilot,Wiki page is accusatory — rewrote from you are failing to you gain,0.25,Retained — full rewrite accepted,Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal (final version),Same five points. Opposite posture. Copilot's rewrite accepted without modification.
4 - Demo design,Gemini,30-minute demonstration choreography + Python wrapper spec + weight-shift simulation,0.6,Retained in full,ramsar_huf_demo.py + food_guide_demo.py,Gemini designed the demo. Claude built and ran it. Clean output confirmed.
4 - Demo design,Claude,Integration — built both scripts / ran both / confirmed output matches primer vocabulary,0.4,Retained — execution only,Both .py files in demos/,food_guide_demo.py: first real-data demo using public Canada Food Guide data.
