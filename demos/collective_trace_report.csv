1 - First dispersal,Grok,Croatia site data verification + mathematical elaborations (sections 10.16-10.24),0.15,Retained — citations only,RSIS site data table,Useful data layer. Narrative sections discarded. Grok pattern confirmed: scope lock required.
1 - First dispersal,Gemini,Three friction points: normalization too abstract / artifact vocabulary alienating / pilot rationale mismatches core problem,0.3,Retained in full,Transboundary gravity framing for Croatia pilot,Highest signal in round 1. Produced the single most important rewrite: EU data portal rationale replaced by ecological governance framing.
1 - First dispersal,ChatGPT,Seven failure points including proposal smell in pilot section,0.3,Retained — minimum wording shifts only,Four minimum wording shifts applied to primer,Correctly identified register problem. Shifts: proposed→candidate / would run→can be structured / primary pathway→potential pathway.
1 - First dispersal,Copilot,Six failure points including cognitive load and first-paragraph abstract framing,0.2,Retained — posture diagnosis only,Audience framing guidance,Arrived skeptical. Diagnosis of cognitive load used to restructure artifact vocabulary section.
1 - First dispersal,Claude,Integration and build — primer v1→v2,0.05,Retained — execution only,Primer v2,Integration role. No independent findings this round.
2 - Scientific Operator,Gemini,Black box problem: who sets the weights? Named the missing operator role,0.5,Retained in full,Scientific Operator paragraph added to primer,Single most important structural fix in the entire cycle. One sentence changed the document posture: HUF does not decide — your scientific teams do.
2 - Scientific Operator,ChatGPT,Administrative safety: audit framing triggers compliance defensiveness,0.25,Retained — reframing only,Subtitle changed: traceability layer→decision-support layer,Correctly flagged audit language as political liability for Secretariat readers.
2 - Scientific Operator,Gemini (round 2),Async data gap: frozen data assumption will cause scientist to put document down,0.25,Retained in full,Async traceability sentence added to pilot section,Precision without accuracy — the phrase that closed the async data argument.
2 - Scientific Operator,Grok,COP14/COP15 elaborations / Fifth Strategic Plan / Freshwater Challenge,0.0,Discarded — off scope,None — filed for JAES paper,Useful for academic paper. Not for primer. Discarded with accounting.
3 - Inversion,Gemini,Five strongest counter-arguments against HUF adoption,0.4,Retained — inverted entirely,Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal in Your System (first draft),Operator reframe: these are not flaws in HUF — these are the flaws the system presents to HUF.
3 - Inversion,Operator (Peter Higgins),Inversion instruction: hide nothing / surface all five / if they fix them they fix themselves,1.0,Retained — this is the core posture,Protection line added to primer / wiki page restructured,Not an agent contribution. Operator decision. Recorded here because it changed the framework more than any single agent finding.
3 - Inversion,Gemini,Uncertainty is a regime — data age as entropy weight in error budget,0.35,Retained in full,Section 3 of wiki page updated,The line that closed the async data argument permanently.
3 - Inversion,Copilot,Wiki page is accusatory — rewrote from you are failing to you gain,0.25,Retained — full rewrite accepted,Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal (final version),Same five points. Opposite posture. Copilot's rewrite accepted without modification.
4 - Demo design,Gemini,30-minute demonstration choreography + Python wrapper spec + weight-shift simulation,0.6,Retained in full,ramsar_huf_demo.py + food_guide_demo.py,Gemini designed the demo. Claude built and ran it. Clean output confirmed.
4 - Demo design,Claude,Integration — built both scripts / ran both / confirmed output matches primer vocabulary,0.4,Retained — execution only,Both .py files in demos/,food_guide_demo.py: first real-data demo using public Canada Food Guide data.
5 - Posture pass v5	Grok	Citation risk analysis â€” three findings: CHF figure already removed / 93000 ha needs inline source / endemism correctly hedged	0.2	Retained â€” citation finding only	93590 ha RSIS source identified and queued for v6	Grok churned beyond scope (sections 10.25-10.28: RSIS verification / Neretva discrepancy / transboundary frameworks / Ramsar guidelines). All backlogged for Phase D.
5 - Posture pass v5	Gemini	Section 2 logical tension: tools are good AND tools cannot show this â€” cognitive dissonance for scientist reader	0.4	Retained in full	METT scope framing sentence added to v6	The structural tension no previous pass caught. Resolved with one framing sentence: not a limitation of METT â€” outside its scope.
5 - Posture pass v5	ChatGPT	Section 4 only â€” two phrases in proposal register: the next step is / will be generated	0.25	Retained â€” two word-level shifts	Section 4 shifts: the next step isâ†’one optional next step could be / willâ†’can	Scoped correctly. Same proposal-smell reflex found in v1 still expressing itself. Two instances remaining in v5. Both resolved.
5 - Posture pass v5	Copilot	Pass with one caution â€” thirty-minute demonstration phrase still reads as action step	0.15	Retained â€” caution overlaps ChatGPT finding	Caution filed â€” addressed in same Section 4 pass	First near-pass from Copilot. Three-sentence verdict. Highest-risk item named and resolved.
5 - Posture pass v5	Claude (sealed)	Primer-to-demo vocabulary gap â€” two output filenames did not match primer vocabulary	0	Retained â€” sealed until all answers returned	Demo script v2: drift_logâ†’portfolio_change_log / discarded_share_recordâ†’coverage_record	Sealed question methodology. Claude's question written and not read until all four answers submitted. Gap confirmed by Gemini in v6 review as external verification.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v6 confirmed â€” tools tension resolved / demo vocabulary aligned / the transition from pitching a tool to offering a diagnostic mirror is complete	0.3	Retained â€” confirmation + phrase	v6 confirmed GO	Convert moment. Phrase filed for trace record: the transition from pitching a tool to offering a diagnostic mirror is complete.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v6 Section 10.27 â€” clean pass â€” no structural finding â€” note on version reference in demo comments	0.1	Retained â€” version flag only	Version reference updated in demo script comments	Grok ran old demo version in test. Note valid but session artifact. No structural finding on v6.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	Full document review (broke scope â€” was assigned Section 4 only) â€” four new primer findings / five demo findings	0.35	Retained in full	v8 surgical pass: Article 3.2 collapsed / MedWet removed / METT jab identified / Target 15 clarified / funding pathways moved	Broke scope. Findings used anyway. Repo guardian instinct overrode the constraint. Highest-value out-of-scope breach in the cycle.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v6 unconditional pass â€” external voice observation â€” produced full Secretariat-register rewrite v6-SR unprompted	0.25	Retained â€” register rewrite accepted as parallel artifact	v6-SR: same claims / same structure / Secretariat-native voice	First unconditional pass from Copilot in entire cycle. v6-SR becomes the Phase C forwarding register.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Reciprocity flip instruction â€” invert the METT jab â€” same ground state principle as the original formula	1	Retained â€” locked before v7 build	METT line flipped: The framework is doing the job METT was never asked to do â†’ METT does exactly what it was designed to do. So does this framework â€” for a different question.	Operator applied the inversion principle from the acoustic ground state. Both collective verdicts satisfied simultaneously.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v7 synthesis brief â€” produced full v7 text from v6 + v6-SR + Gemini anchors â€” flagged Scientific Operator as internal HUF vocabulary	0.3	Retained â€” one pre-build correction applied	Primer v7 / Scientific Operatorâ†’scientific team's declared priorities	Delivered clean and on scope. Given the synthesis task because it produced both the skeptic pass and the register rewrite.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v7 Sections 10.28-10.30 â€” repo scrape / RSIS Python extraction script / EU WFD integration / Neretva RBMP / ARIMA drift elaboration	0	Discarded â€” Phase D and JAES backlog	All sections filed in session transcript	No objection to v7 = implicit GO. Mountain building resumed after verdict. RSIS extraction script ready for Phase D.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v7 definitive GO â€” four-criteria breakdown all green â€” pre-flight: wiki coherence mapâ†’portfolio share table	0.2	Retained â€” GO + wiki fix queued	GO confirmed / pre-flight check filed	It finally reads like something a Ramsar policy officer could bring into a meeting without risk.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	v9 surgical pass â€” six micro-edits â€” produced ramsar_contact_primer_v7_surgical_bundle.zip with CHANGELOG	0.35	Retained in full	Primer v8 built directly from surgical docx â€” CHANGELOG is the trace record	CHANGELOG-driven build. Most traceable single pass in the cycle. Every edit listed by name.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v8 pass â€” bidirectional detection property surfaced independently without being told it existed	0.25	Retained in full	Primer v9: bidirectional sentence added to Section 2	Copilot found the JAES seed through the review process. Translated the property into plain governance language and placed it correctly. The framework surfaced its own depth.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v9 GO â€” first unconditional GO from Grok in entire cycle â€” one verdict / no elaboration / no sections	0.1	Retained â€” confirmation only	GO confirmed	The mountain builder went quiet. Grok silence = the document is done.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v9 definitive GO â€” four-criteria breakdown â€” one pre-flight: wiki vocabulary â€” the lights are green	0.15	Retained â€” GO + pre-flight	GO confirmed	The lights are green. The framework is as coherent as it can be without the friction of a live human conversation.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	v9 conditional GO â€” two credibility hostages: MedWet obligations / verification required	0.3	Retained â€” both fixes applied in v10	Primer v10 built: obligationsâ†’workflows / verification requiredâ†’RSIS cite	Conditional GO held correctly. Full GO on v10. Repo guardian role confirmed across entire cycle.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Fortress decision â€” publish internally / hold external send / build bastions before any forwarding	1	Retained â€” this is Phase B posture	Fortress framework: four bastion wiki pages + sidebar	No letter leaves before the bastions are built. Slow and methodical confirmed as the operator posture.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Claude	Fortress build â€” merged Claude and ChatGPT bastion versions â€” no duplication	0.2	Retained â€” execution only	wiki_ramsar_primer_v10.md / wiki_ramsar_scope_boundary.md / wiki_bastion_b_skeptic_qa.md / wiki_bastion_c_demo_artifact_trail.md / wiki_sidebar_ramsar_section.md	ChatGPT contributed: safe language policy / evaluation protocol / scope framing.
