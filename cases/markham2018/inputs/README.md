# Inputs (not bundled)

This case uses a **real City of Markham** budget workbook. The input workbook is not bundled so the distribution stays small and because Markham publishes it publicly.

## Required file
Place the workbook at:

- `cases/markham2018/inputs/2018-Budget-Allocation-of-Revenue-and-Expenditure-by-Fund.xlsx`

## Where to download
Download the document “2018 Corporate-Wide Budget – Allocation of Revenue & Expenditure by Fund” from the City of Markham Open Data catalogue.

See `DATA_SOURCES.md` (repo root) for links.

## After download
Run:

```bash
huf markham2018 --input cases/markham2018/inputs/2018-Budget-Allocation-of-Revenue-and-Expenditure-by-Fund.xlsx
```
