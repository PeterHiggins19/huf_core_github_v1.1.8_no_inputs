# Partnerships

This section is the “go-to-market” sibling of the technical docs.

HUF is easiest to understand when you can *run it in 60 seconds*, then show a colleague:

- **Where the mass is** (coherence map)
- **What to review first** (active set)
- **What was dropped, explicitly** (error budget)
- **Why something survived** (trace)

Partnership pages package that into “PR + proof + two commands”.

## Current packages

### Weaviate

- **Weaviate outreach package**: `partnerships/weaviate_outreach.md`

This includes:
- PR title + description (ready to paste)
- a short follow‑up email template (send after PR link exists)
- Windows-safe commands and expected output shape

---

## Next targets

These are “stubs” for now — add packages as you build them:

- Qdrant (collection / payload coherence)
- Pinecone (namespace dominance / multi‑tenant audit)
- LangChain / LlamaIndex (retrieval callback → coherence report)

---

## Ground rule

**PR first, email second.**  
A reviewable PR is the best proof artifact: it reduces meeting overhead and makes the ask concrete.
