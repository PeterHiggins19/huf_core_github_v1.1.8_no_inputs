# Contributing

Contributions are welcome — even small things like typo fixes or “this step confused me” issues help a lot.

## The easiest ways to help

1. **Open an Issue** (best for feedback / questions)
   - Describe what you tried, what happened, and what you expected.
   - If it’s about a command, paste the exact command + the terminal output.

2. **Send a Pull Request**
   - Fork the repo → create a branch → make changes → open a PR.
   - Docs-only PRs are totally fine (they’re often the most valuable).

## Suggested contribution ideas

- Add a small new “worked example” page for a dataset you care about
- Improve Windows copy/paste reliability
- Add tiny helper scripts (inspect artifacts, sanity checks, etc.)

## Repo settings that help contributors

- Issues: **Enabled**
- Pull requests from forks: **Enabled**
- Branch protection (optional): require CI checks on `main`

The canonical contributor guidance lives in the root **CONTRIBUTING.md** in the repo.
