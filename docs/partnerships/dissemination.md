# Dissemination checklist

This is the repeatable “no meeting required” distribution strategy.

1) **Publish** the partner package in docs (stable link)
2) **Open a PR** in the partner’s examples repo (proof artifact)
3) **Post** PR link in a community channel (Slack/Discord/GitHub Discussion)
4) **Email** partner manager with PR link in the first paragraph
5) **Follow up once** after 5–7 business days
6) **Offer one co-authored asset**: short blog outline + screenshot/plots

Metrics to track:
- PR merged
- integration directory listing
- partner blog post published
- inbound GitHub stars / clones from partner referral
- repeatable proof line shared by others

Tip: keep every demo “two commands” and Windows-safe.
