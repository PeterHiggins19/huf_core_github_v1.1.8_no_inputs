# Public sector — long-tail accounting lens

HUF long-tail here is **not ML class imbalance**.

It means:

- mass distribution (where spending/volume concentrates)
- exception reweighting (what changes after thresholding)

Example: baseline P&L → exception-only P&L → ranked variance review.

Use cases:
- budget line items (Markham)
- operational logs (Toronto traffic)
