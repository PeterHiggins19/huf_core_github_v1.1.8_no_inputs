# Ethics & disclosure (AI-assisted drafting)

## What this page is
A transparency statement about how these documents were produced and what the reader should and should not infer about the authority of the text.

## AI assistance disclosure
Portions of this documentation were drafted and edited using an AI-assisted drafting tool. The tool was used for:
- reformatting and restructuring text
- improving clarity and readability
- generating alternative phrasings and organizing outlines

## Author responsibility
The author reviewed and curated the final wording and is responsible for:
- the intended meaning of formal definitions and claims
- the scope boundaries between formal core and interpretive discussion
- the correctness of any results presented as established

## Reproducibility commitment
Where claims depend on computation, the project aims to make results reproducible through:
- code and scripts in the repository
- deterministic runs where possible
- documented inputs/outputs and audit checks

## Conservative stance on claims
This documentation avoids presenting speculative equivalences as established results. In particular:
- analogies to other mathematical areas are labeled as *interpretive* unless formally proven
- domain applications are presented as *use cases*, not as derivations of domain laws

## How to cite / use responsibly
If you use HUF in academic or engineering work:
- cite the repository and the specific version of the docs
- report assumptions and failure modes
- prefer minimal, testable claims over broad unification language
